        "content": "\"Los Darkos\" most commonly refers to a musical group, but the term also appears in other unrelated contexts, including fictional characters and software projects.\n\n1. Music Group:  \nLos Darkos is the name of a musical artist or band, with songs available on platforms like Pandora[3]. Their music includes tracks such as \"Como Fui a Enamorarme de Ti,\" and they have a presence on streaming services, suggesting they are active in the Latin music scene[3].\n\n2. Other Uses:  \n- In fiction, \"Darkos\" is the name of a character in the \"Arthur and the Minimoys\" franchise, where Darkos is the son of Maltazard and a commander of the Seides[1].  \n- \"Los Dark\" (not \"Los Darkos\") appears in the Power Rangers universe as an undead captain named Los Dark, unrelated to the music group[2].  \n- \"Darkos\" is also the name of a software project designed to run Windows x86_64 applications and games on Android devices using Termux, Box86, and Box64[4].\n\nIf you are seeking information about the musical group, they are best known for their songs in the Latin genre and are available on major streaming platforms[3]. If you meant another context, such as fiction or software, please specify for more targeted information."
